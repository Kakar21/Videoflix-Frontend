# Videoflix Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Videoflix project, a Netflix clone for streaming videos. 

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Frontend and Backend Projects**
   - Clone this frontend project.
   - Clone the backend project as well (find the backend [here](https://github.com/Kakar21/Videoflix-Backend)).

2. **Setup and Start the Backend**
   - Follow the instructions in the backend project's README (available [here](https://github.com/Kakar21/Videoflix-Backend/blob/main/README.md)) to set up and start the backend server.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the project root and install all dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the Frontend**
   - Start the live server using Angular CLI:
     ```bash
     ng serve --open
     ```
   - This will open Videoflix in your browser and connect to the backend if it's running correctly.

5. **Create a User and Verify Email**
   - Sign up as a new user.
   - Verify your email address as prompted.
   - Enjoy Videoflix!
